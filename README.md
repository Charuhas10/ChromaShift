# ChromaShift

ChromaShift is a simple web application that allows users to input any color in hex code and provides them with the option to lighten or darken the color. Users can specify the amount of percentage they want to change the color by, providing a flexible and interactive way to modify colors.

The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, making it easily accessible and compatible with modern web browsers. It offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the color modification process.

- Lighten or darken the color: ChromaShift provides users with the option to lighten or darken the input color. This allows them to adjust the color to their desired shade.
